//! rTimelogger â€” a simple command-line time logging tool.
//!
//! This crate provides the core library used by the `rtimelog` CLI. It contains
//! modules for command-line parsing, configuration, database access, event
//! modeling, and the business logic driving the application.
//!
//! The main crate documentation is included from the repository `README.md` so
//! that docs.rs and `cargo doc` present the same introduction and examples as
//! the project README.
