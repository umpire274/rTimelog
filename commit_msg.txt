Fix: resolve compilation errors and deduplicate event-creation logic in src/commands.rs 
 
- Fixed mismatched delimiters and invalid patterns in handle_add that caused parsing/compiler errors. 
- Removed lifetime-unsafe closure and construct AddEventArgs inline to avoid temporary borrows. 
- Consolidated duplicate 'create missing event' logic into a single local helper to reduce duplication. 
- Adjusted validations and conditions for robust time parsing and updates. 
- Ran cargo build and full test suite locally; all tests passed.
